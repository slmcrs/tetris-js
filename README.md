# tetris-js
Just another tetris clone in HTML5 + JS

## What is left to do:
- Important:
  * check if game is over when pieces reach the top
  * colorize/texture blocks for each piece
  * side panel that shows next piece & score
  * scoring system
  * add start & pause menu
- Not so important:
  * when player rotates against the wall, push block over to accommodate new width
  * show ghost piece at the lowest point the piece can go straight down
  * add button to send piece down instantly
  * delay setting of piece if player moves across or rotates --Think it already
  does this, at least it does for me--
